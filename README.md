## Installation

Clone with SSH Key:
git@github.com:cwf1984/Vanessas-Portfolio.git

Or use the URL listed below to view the live webpage.

## Usage

* Each navigation link directs the user to the About Me section, the Work section (which does not have live links as of yet), and information to contact me. Clicking on resume will pull up a PDF of my most recent resume created in early 2019 (this will be updated soon).
* The images in the work section were coded using the flexbox layout in CSS. 

## Images

Below is an image of the issues I was having trying to incorporate a textbox onto the images:

## Credits

Thank you to Bootcamp Spot, the University of Washington and Trilogy Education for the guidelines given to create this project. It provided a great deal of practice and also showed me what I need to keep working on.
